MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is a design pattern commonly used in applications, especially those with a user interface (UI), like those built with .NET Core 6 and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) or Xamarin. The primary goal of MVVM is to separate the development of the graphical user interface from the business logic or back-end logic. This separation makes it easier to manage, test, and maintain the application.

**Components of MVVM**
1. **Model:** Represents the data and the business logic of the application. It includes the data structures, business rules, and methods to retrieve and manipulate data. The model is independent of the UI.

1. **View:** Represents the user interface of the application. It displays the data contained in the model and sends user commands to the ViewModel. The view is typically defined in XAML (for WPF) or HTML (for web applications).

1. **ViewModel:** Acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model. It retrieves data from the Model, formats it for display, and responds to user input from the View. The ViewModel contains the logic to manage the UI's state and behavior.

**Conclusion**

This simple console application demonstrates how the MVVM pattern works by separating the concerns of data (Model), logic (ViewModel), and presentation (View). In real-world applications, especially with UI frameworks like WPF or Xamarin, the View would typically be defined using XAML or HTML, and data binding would be used to automatically synchronize the View and ViewModel properties.
